https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c/

npm start (open app in a browser)
npm run electron / electron . (open desktop app) 

If you run 'npm run electron' without 'npm start' you will get the blank desktop app, so first run 'npm start' and then 'npm run electron'
